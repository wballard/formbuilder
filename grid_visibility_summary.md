# Grid Visibility Fix Summary

## Changes Made

1. **Initial Fix (AnimatedGridWidget)**:
   - Fixed opacity initialization in `AnimatedGridWidget` by setting `_gridLinesController.value = 1.0` when `showGridLines` is true
   - This ensures grid lines start fully visible instead of fading in from 0 opacity

2. **Stack Order Fix (GridContainer)**:
   - Moved grid lines to the top layer in the Stack
   - Wrapped `AccessibleGridWidget` in `IgnorePointer` to prevent interaction interference
   - This fixed the issue where `LayoutGrid` was covering the grid lines

3. **Visibility Enhancement**:
   - Changed grid line color from `Colors.grey` to `Colors.black54` for better contrast
   - Increased line width from 1.0 to 1.5 for better visibility
   - The original grey color had a contrast ratio of 2.55:1 against the scaffold background, which was below WCAG recommendations

## Technical Details

The grid rendering pipeline is:
```
GridContainer 
└── Stack
    ├── LayoutGrid (placed widgets)
    └── IgnorePointer (if !isPreviewMode)
        └── AccessibleGridWidget
            └── AnimatedGridWidget
                └── CustomPaint with _AnimatedGridPainter
```

The issue was twofold:
1. Grid lines were being animated from 0 opacity even when they should be immediately visible
2. The stacking order placed the grid behind the widget layer

## Result

Grid lines are now visible in all GridContainer stories:
- Basic Layout
- Different Sizes  
- Form Example
- Interactive Selection (with animation disabled)

The grid lines appear as semi-transparent black lines (54% opacity) with 1.5px width, providing good visibility without being too prominent.
