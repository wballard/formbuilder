# Step 25: Animations and Transitions

## Context
Add smooth animations to enhance the user experience and provide visual feedback.

## Task
Implement animations throughout the form builder for a polished feel.

## Prompt
```text
Add animations to the form builder:

1. Widget placement animations:
   - Animate new widgets appearing (scale + fade in)
   - Use AnimatedContainer for position changes
   - Duration: 200-300ms with curves

2. Grid animations:
   - Animate grid resize with AnimatedContainer
   - Smooth cell highlighting transitions
   - Grid line fade in/out in preview mode

3. Selection animations:
   - Animate selection border appearance
   - Pulse effect on selection
   - Smooth focus transitions

4. Drag feedback:
   - Scale animation on drag start (1.0 -> 1.05)
   - Smooth opacity changes
   - Drop animation (slight bounce)

5. Delete animations:
   - Scale + fade out when deleting
   - Stagger remaining widgets shifting

6. Mode transitions:
   - Smooth transition to/from preview mode
   - Crossfade between edit and preview UI
   - Toolbar slide animations

7. Create AnimationSettings:
   - Allow customizing durations
   - Allow disabling animations
   - Respect prefers-reduced-motion

8. Implementation approach:
   - Use implicit animations where possible
   - Hero animations for mode transitions
   - Consistent timing and curves

This adds polish and improves usability through motion.
```

## Success Criteria
- Animations feel smooth and natural
- No janky or abrupt transitions
- Animations enhance usability
- Performance remains good
- Respects accessibility preferences
