# Step 6: Basic Grid Widget

## Context
With our data models in place, we can start building the visual components. We'll begin with a basic grid widget that displays the grid structure.

## Task
Create a GridWidget that renders the grid layout with visual indicators.

## Prompt
```text
Create GridWidget in lib/form_layout/widgets/grid_widget.dart:

1. Create a stateless GridWidget with properties:
   - GridDimensions dimensions
   - Color gridLineColor (default: Colors.grey.shade300)
   - double gridLineWidth (default: 1.0)
   - Color backgroundColor (default: Colors.white)
   - EdgeInsets padding (default: EdgeInsets.all(8))

2. Use flutter_layout_grid to render the grid:
   - Create empty cells for the grid structure
   - Show grid lines between cells
   - Make the grid fill available space proportionally

3. Style requirements:
   - Grid lines should be subtle but visible
   - Grid should have a border around the entire area
   - Cells should be square when possible
   - Respond to theme colors appropriately

4. Create unit tests in test/widgets/grid_widget_test.dart:
   - Test grid renders with correct dimensions
   - Test custom colors are applied
   - Test padding is respected
   - Use golden tests for visual regression

5. Create a Storybook story in lib/stories/grid_widget_story.dart:
   - Show grids of different sizes (2x2, 4x4, 6x3, etc.)
   - Show grid with custom colors
   - Add knobs for interactive dimension changes

This establishes the visual foundation for the form builder.
```

## Success Criteria
- Grid displays with correct dimensions
- Grid lines and styling work as specified
- Grid is responsive and fills space appropriately
- Story allows interactive exploration
- Tests ensure visual consistency
