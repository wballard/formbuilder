# Step 16: Grid Container Resize Support

## Context
The GridContainer needs to handle resize operations and validate new dimensions.

## Task
Update GridContainer and GridDragTarget to support widget resizing.

## Prompt
```text
Enhance grid components to handle resize operations:

1. Update GridContainer:
   - Add Set<String> resizingWidgetIds property
   - Add void Function(String widgetId, WidgetPlacement)? onWidgetResize
   - Show resize handles on selected widgets
   - Pass resize callbacks to PlacedWidget

2. Create ResizeDragTarget wrapper:
   - Handles DragTarget<ResizeData>
   - Calculates new dimensions during drag
   - Validates resize doesn't overlap other widgets
   - Shows preview of new size

3. Resize calculation logic:
   - Track initial widget placement
   - Calculate dimension delta from drag distance
   - Snap to grid cells
   - Respect minimum size (1x1)
   - Respect maximum size (grid bounds)
   - Prevent overlaps with other widgets

4. Visual feedback during resize:
   - Show ghost outline of new size
   - Highlight grid cells that will be occupied
   - Use error color if resize is invalid
   - Show dimension label (e.g., "3x2 cells")

5. Integration:
   - Coordinate with move operations
   - Ensure resize and move don't conflict
   - Update layout state on successful resize

6. Create tests:
   - Test resize calculations
   - Test boundary constraints
   - Test overlap prevention
   - Test visual feedback

This completes widget resizing functionality.
```

## Success Criteria
- Widgets can be resized by dragging handles
- Invalid resizes are prevented visually
- Grid bounds are respected
- Overlaps are prevented
- Visual feedback guides the user
