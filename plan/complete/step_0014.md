# Step 14: Grid Drag Target for Moving Widgets

## Context
The GridDragTarget needs to handle both new widgets from the toolbox and existing widgets being moved.

## Task
Enhance GridDragTarget to accept dragged PlacedWidgets for repositioning.

## Prompt
```text
Update GridDragTarget to handle moving existing widgets:

1. Change to handle multiple drag types:
   - Wrap with two DragTargets (one for ToolboxItem, one for WidgetPlacement)
   - Or use a base class/union type for drag data
   - Maintain separate logic for each drag type

2. For WidgetPlacement drags:
   - Track the widget being moved
   - Exclude it from overlap calculations (can overlap its current position)
   - Calculate new position based on drag location
   - void Function(String widgetId, WidgetPlacement newPlacement)? onWidgetMoved

3. Update position calculation:
   - For moved widgets, use their existing dimensions
   - Allow partial positioning (snap to grid)
   - Ensure widget stays within grid bounds

4. Visual feedback during move:
   - Highlight new position cells
   - Show invalid if overlapping other widgets
   - Keep original position visible but dimmed

5. Update GridContainer integration:
   - Pass dragging widget IDs to show dragging state
   - Original position shows as semi-transparent

6. Handle drop:
   - If valid position, call onWidgetMoved
   - If invalid, widget snaps back (no change)

7. Update tests and story:
   - Test moving widgets to valid positions
   - Test overlap prevention
   - Test edge boundary handling

This completes the core drag and drop functionality.
```

## Success Criteria
- Widgets can be moved to new positions
- Invalid moves are prevented
- Visual feedback is clear for valid/invalid moves
- Original position is visible during drag
- Both new and move operations work together
