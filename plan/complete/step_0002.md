# Step 2: Core Data Models - Grid Dimensions

## Context
With the project structure in place, we need to define the core data models that will represent our form layout system. We'll start with the grid dimensions model.

## Task
Create the GridDimensions model that defines the size of our layout grid.

## Prompt
```text
Create a GridDimensions model in lib/form_layout/models/grid_dimensions.dart with the following requirements:

1. Create an immutable class GridDimensions with:
   - int columns (minimum 1, maximum 12)
   - int rows (minimum 1, maximum 20)
   - Constructor with validation
   - copyWith method for creating modified instances
   - equality and hashCode implementations
   - toString for debugging

2. Add validation to ensure:
   - Columns are between 1 and 12
   - Rows are between 1 and 20
   - Throw ArgumentError for invalid values

3. Create unit tests in test/models/grid_dimensions_test.dart to verify:
   - Valid construction
   - Invalid values throw errors
   - copyWith works correctly
   - Equality works as expected

4. Add a simple Storybook story in lib/stories/models_story.dart that displays the model's constraints

Follow Dart best practices and ensure the code passes flutter analyze.
```

## Success Criteria
- GridDimensions model is created with proper validation
- All unit tests pass
- Model is immutable with working copyWith
- Story displays model information in Storybook
