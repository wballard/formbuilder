# Step 3: Core Data Models - Widget Placement

## Context
Now we need a model to represent where widgets are placed on the grid and their size.

## Task
Create the WidgetPlacement model that defines a widget's position and size on the grid.

## Prompt
```text
Create a WidgetPlacement model in lib/form_layout/models/widget_placement.dart with:

1. Create an immutable class WidgetPlacement with:
   - String id (unique identifier for the widget)
   - String widgetName (name from the toolbox)
   - int column (0-based column position)
   - int row (0-based row position)
   - int width (columns spanned, minimum 1)
   - int height (rows spanned, minimum 1)
   - Constructor with validation
   - copyWith method
   - Equality and hashCode implementations

2. Add validation methods:
   - bool fitsInGrid(GridDimensions dimensions) - checks if placement fits
   - bool overlaps(WidgetPlacement other) - checks for overlap
   - Rectangle<int> get bounds - returns the bounding rectangle

3. Create unit tests in test/models/widget_placement_test.dart:
   - Test construction and validation
   - Test fitsInGrid with various grid sizes
   - Test overlaps detection
   - Test bounds calculation
   - Test copyWith functionality

4. Update the models story to include WidgetPlacement examples

Ensure the model works well with the previously created GridDimensions model.
```

## Success Criteria
- WidgetPlacement model created with validation
- Overlap detection works correctly
- Grid fitting validation works
- All tests pass
- Model integrates with GridDimensions
