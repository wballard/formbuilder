# Step 28: Performance Optimizations

## Context
Optimize the form builder for smooth performance with large forms and complex widgets.

## Task
Implement performance optimizations throughout the system.

## Prompt
```text
Add performance optimizations:

1. Widget rendering optimization:
   - Use const constructors where possible
   - Implement RepaintBoundary for complex widgets
   - Cache widget builders to avoid rebuilds
   - Use keys effectively for widget identity

2. State management optimization:
   - Minimize rebuilds with selective updates
   - Use ValueListenableBuilder for specific values
   - Debounce rapid state changes
   - Batch operations when possible

3. Drag operation optimization:
   - Throttle drag position updates
   - Use lower resolution during active drag
   - Defer expensive calculations
   - Simplify visual feedback during drag

4. Large grid optimization:
   - Virtual scrolling for very large grids
   - Only render visible grid cells
   - Lazy load widget content
   - Efficient overlap detection algorithms

5. Memory optimization:
   - Limit undo/redo history size
   - Clean up resources properly
   - Avoid memory leaks in hooks
   - Efficient data structures

6. Create performance monitoring:
   - Add performance overlay option
   - Track frame times
   - Identify slow operations
   - Add debug performance stats

7. Optimization settings:
   - Quality levels (high/medium/low)
   - Disable animations on low-end devices
   - Configurable update rates

8. Create performance tests:
   - Stress test with many widgets
   - Measure frame rates
   - Profile memory usage

This ensures smooth operation even with complex forms.
```

## Success Criteria
- 60 FPS during normal operations
- Smooth dragging even with many widgets
- Reasonable memory usage
- No UI freezes or stutters
- Performance scales with form complexity
