# Step 22: Form Preview Mode

## Context
Users need to preview how their form will look and function for end users.

## Task
Implement a preview mode that shows the form without editing capabilities.

## Prompt
```text
Create preview mode for the form builder:

1. Add preview mode to FormLayoutController:
   - bool isPreviewMode property
   - void togglePreviewMode() method
   - void setPreviewMode(bool preview) method

2. Create FormPreview widget in lib/form_layout/widgets/form_preview.dart:
   - Takes LayoutState and widgetBuilders
   - Renders form without editing UI
   - No selection, dragging, or resize handles
   - Clean presentation for end users

3. Preview mode differences:
   - Hide grid lines
   - Hide resize controls
   - Disable drag and drop
   - Hide toolbox
   - Show only the form content
   - Enable form interactions (buttons, inputs work)

4. Visual indicators:
   - Different background in preview mode
   - "Preview Mode" badge or indicator
   - Smooth transition animation between modes

5. Update GridContainer:
   - Accept isPreviewMode flag
   - Conditionally show edit UI
   - Pass through to PlacedWidget

6. Keyboard shortcut:
   - Ctrl/Cmd+P: Toggle preview mode
   - Escape in preview: Return to edit mode

7. Create tests and story:
   - Test preview mode rendering
   - Test interaction differences
   - Show mode toggle in story

This lets users see exactly how their form will appear to end users.
```

## Success Criteria
- Preview mode hides all editing UI
- Form widgets remain interactive
- Clear visual distinction between modes
- Smooth transition between modes
- Easy to toggle via UI and keyboard
