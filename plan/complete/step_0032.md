# Step 32: Comprehensive Widget Tests

## Context
Ensure robust test coverage for all form builder components.

## Task
Create comprehensive widget tests for the form builder.

## Prompt
```text
Create comprehensive test suite:

1. Integration tests in test/integration/:
   - Full drag and drop flow
   - Add widget -> move -> resize -> delete
   - Undo/redo sequences
   - Grid resize with widgets
   - Preview mode transitions

2. Widget interaction tests:
   - Test all user interactions
   - Mouse, touch, and keyboard
   - Edge cases and error conditions
   - Performance under load

3. Golden tests:
   - Visual regression tests
   - Different themes
   - Various screen sizes
   - All widget states

4. Accessibility tests:
   - Screen reader navigation
   - Keyboard-only operation
   - Focus management
   - Semantic correctness

5. State management tests:
   - Complex state transitions
   - Concurrent operations
   - State consistency
   - Memory leaks

6. Create test utilities:
   - Test widget builders
   - Mock drag operations
   - State assertions
   - Custom matchers

7. Test data generators:
   - Random layout generation
   - Stress test scenarios
   - Edge case layouts

8. Coverage requirements:
   - Minimum 90% code coverage
   - All public APIs tested
   - All error paths tested

This ensures the form builder is reliable and bug-free.
```

## Success Criteria
- High test coverage achieved
- Tests are maintainable
- Tests catch regressions
- Tests run quickly
- Clear test documentation
