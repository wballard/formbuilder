# Step 21: Keyboard Navigation

## Context
For accessibility and power users, we need comprehensive keyboard navigation and shortcuts.

## Task
Implement keyboard navigation and shortcuts for the form builder.

## Prompt
```text
Add keyboard support to the form builder:

1. Create KeyboardHandler widget in lib/form_layout/widgets/keyboard_handler.dart:
   - Wraps the entire form builder
   - Uses Focus and RawKeyboardListener
   - Handles key events and dispatches actions

2. Navigation keys:
   - Arrow keys: Move selection between widgets
   - Tab/Shift+Tab: Cycle through widgets
   - Enter: Enter edit mode for selected widget
   - Escape: Deselect widget

3. Operation shortcuts:
   - Delete/Backspace: Delete selected widget
   - Ctrl/Cmd+Z: Undo
   - Ctrl/Cmd+Y or Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+Z: Redo
   - Ctrl/Cmd+D: Duplicate selected widget
   - Ctrl/Cmd+A: Select all widgets (multi-select prep)

4. Widget manipulation:
   - Shift+Arrows: Move widget by one grid cell
   - Ctrl/Cmd+Arrows: Resize widget
   - Space: Toggle between move/resize mode

5. Focus management:
   - Visible focus indicators on widgets
   - Focus trap within form builder
   - Proper focus restoration

6. Update FormLayoutController:
   - Add keyboard action methods
   - Track focus state
   - Handle multi-selection (future)

7. Create tests:
   - Test all keyboard shortcuts
   - Test focus management
   - Test key event handling

This makes the form builder fully keyboard accessible.
```

## Success Criteria
- All major operations available via keyboard
- Focus indicators are clear
- Navigation is logical and predictable
- Shortcuts follow platform conventions
- No keyboard traps
