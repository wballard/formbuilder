# Step 4: Core Data Models - Layout State

## Context
We need a model to represent the complete state of the form layout, including grid dimensions and all widget placements.

## Task
Create the LayoutState model that holds the complete form layout configuration.

## Prompt
```text
Create a LayoutState model in lib/form_layout/models/layout_state.dart:

1. Create an immutable class LayoutState with:
   - GridDimensions dimensions
   - List<WidgetPlacement> widgets (immutable list)
   - Constructor that validates no overlapping widgets
   - copyWith method
   - Factory constructor for empty state with default 4x4 grid

2. Add methods for widget management:
   - bool canAddWidget(WidgetPlacement placement) - checks if widget can be added
   - LayoutState addWidget(WidgetPlacement placement) - returns new state with widget
   - LayoutState removeWidget(String widgetId) - returns new state without widget
   - LayoutState updateWidget(String widgetId, WidgetPlacement newPlacement)
   - WidgetPlacement? getWidget(String widgetId)

3. Add methods for grid management:
   - LayoutState resizeGrid(GridDimensions newDimensions) - removes widgets that don't fit
   - List<WidgetPlacement> getWidgetsInArea(Rectangle<int> area)

4. Create comprehensive unit tests in test/models/layout_state_test.dart:
   - Test adding/removing widgets
   - Test overlap prevention
   - Test grid resizing with widget removal
   - Test widget updates
   - Test area queries

5. Add toJson/fromJson methods for serialization

The model should maintain consistency and prevent invalid states.
```

## Success Criteria
- LayoutState manages widgets and grid consistently
- No overlapping widgets allowed
- Grid resizing handles widget removal properly
- Serialization works correctly
- All tests pass
