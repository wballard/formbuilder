# Step 26: Accessibility Enhancements

## Context
Ensure the form builder is fully accessible to users with disabilities.

## Task
Implement comprehensive accessibility features.

## Prompt
```text
Add accessibility support to the form builder:

1. Screen reader support:
   - Add Semantics widgets throughout
   - Meaningful labels for all interactive elements
   - Announce state changes (widget added, moved, etc.)
   - Grid position announcements ("Column 3, Row 2")

2. Widget semantics:
   - Label: Widget name and position
   - Hint: Available actions (move, resize, delete)
   - Actions: Custom semantic actions for operations
   - Live regions for status updates

3. Toolbox accessibility:
   - Announce draggable items
   - Keyboard activation alternative
   - Clear grouping and navigation

4. Focus management:
   - Visible focus indicators (high contrast)
   - Logical focus order
   - Focus restoration after operations
   - Skip links for navigation

5. Color and contrast:
   - Ensure WCAG AA contrast ratios
   - Don't rely on color alone
   - Support high contrast mode
   - Customizable colors for color blindness

6. Interaction alternatives:
   - All drag operations via keyboard
   - Context menus for touch alternatives
   - Larger hit targets (44x44 minimum)

7. Status announcements:
   - Use Semantics.announce for operations
   - "Widget added to grid"
   - "Widget moved to column 2, row 3"
   - "Cannot place widget, space occupied"

8. Create accessibility tests and documentation

This ensures the form builder is usable by everyone.
