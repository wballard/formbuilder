# Step 18: Grid Resize Controls

## Context
Users need to be able to resize the grid itself by adjusting the number of rows and columns.

## Task
Add controls to resize the grid dimensions.

## Prompt
```text
Create grid resize controls:

1. Create GridResizeControls widget in lib/form_layout/widgets/grid_resize_controls.dart:
   - Position controls on right and bottom edges of grid
   - Show current dimensions
   - Allow dragging to resize
   - Show +/- buttons as alternative

2. Right edge control (for columns):
   - Vertical bar with drag handle
   - Shows column count (e.g., "6 columns")
   - Drag left/right to decrease/increase columns
   - Min: 1, Max: 12 columns

3. Bottom edge control (for rows):
   - Horizontal bar with drag handle  
   - Shows row count (e.g., "4 rows")
   - Drag up/down to decrease/increase rows
   - Min: 1, Max: 20 rows

4. Visual design:
   - Semi-transparent background
   - Subtle but visible drag handles
   - Highlight on hover
   - Show resize cursor

5. Add callbacks:
   - void Function(GridDimensions)? onGridResize
   - Validate new dimensions don't cut off widgets
   - Show warning if widgets would be removed

6. Integration with GridContainer:
   - Wrap grid with resize controls
   - Update layout state on resize
   - Handle widget removal if grid shrinks

7. Create tests and story:
   - Test dimension constraints
   - Test widget removal warnings
   - Interactive resize example

This allows dynamic grid sizing during form design.
```

## Success Criteria
- Grid can be resized by dragging edges
- Dimension constraints are enforced
- Clear visual feedback during resize
- Warns before removing widgets
- Alternative +/- buttons work
