# Step 12: Grid Drag Target

## Context
The grid needs to accept dragged items from the toolbox and determine where they should be placed.

## Task
Create a GridDragTarget widget that wraps the GridContainer and handles drop operations.

## Prompt
```text
Create GridDragTarget in lib/form_layout/widgets/grid_drag_target.dart:

1. Create a stateful GridDragTarget with properties:
   - LayoutState layoutState
   - Map<String, Widget> widgetBuilders
   - Toolbox toolbox
   - void Function(WidgetPlacement)? onWidgetDropped
   - String? selectedWidgetId
   - void Function(String)? onWidgetTap

2. Implement DragTarget<ToolboxItem> wrapping GridContainer:
   - Accept ToolboxItem data type
   - Track current drag position over grid

3. Add drag position tracking:
   - Convert global drag position to grid coordinates
   - Calculate which cells would be occupied
   - Determine if placement is valid (no overlaps)

4. Implement drag callbacks:
   - onWillAccept: Check if drop position is valid
   - onAccept: Create WidgetPlacement and call onWidgetDropped
   - onMove: Update highlighted cells based on drag position

5. Grid coordinate calculation:
   - Use RenderBox to get grid position and size
   - Convert drag position to column/row
   - Account for widget's default dimensions
   - Clamp to grid boundaries

6. Visual feedback:
   - Highlight cells where widget would be placed
   - Use different color for invalid placements
   - Update in real-time as drag moves

7. Create tests and Storybook story showing drop interactions

This enables dropping new widgets onto the grid.
```

## Success Criteria
- Dragged items can be dropped on valid grid positions
- Invalid positions are indicated visually
- Drop creates proper WidgetPlacement
- Coordinates are calculated correctly
- Visual feedback updates smoothly during drag
