# Step 8: Placed Widget Component

## Context
We need a component to render widgets that have been placed on the grid, handling their positioning and sizing.

## Task
Create a PlacedWidget component that renders a widget at its grid position.

## Prompt
```text
Create PlacedWidget in lib/form_layout/widgets/placed_widget.dart:

1. Create a stateless PlacedWidget with properties:
   - WidgetPlacement placement
   - Widget child
   - VoidCallback? onTap
   - bool isSelected (default: false)
   - bool isDragging (default: false)
   - EdgeInsets contentPadding (default: EdgeInsets.all(8))

2. Visual requirements:
   - Show a border when isSelected (2px, primary color)
   - Reduce opacity to 0.5 when isDragging
   - Add subtle shadow/elevation (elevation: 2)
   - Show hover effect on desktop (slight elevation increase)
   - Content should be padded within the cell bounds

3. Interaction:
   - Wrap with InkWell for tap handling
   - Show ripple effect on tap
   - Cursor should be 'move' on hover

4. Create tests in test/widgets/placed_widget_test.dart:
   - Test selected state styling
   - Test dragging state opacity
   - Test tap callbacks
   - Test hover effects (on desktop)

5. Create Storybook story:
   - Show placed widgets in different states
   - Show with different child widgets
   - Interactive example with state toggles

This component will be placed within the grid to show positioned widgets.
```

## Success Criteria
- PlacedWidget renders with correct styling
- Selection and dragging states are visually distinct
- Interactions work smoothly
- Component is reusable with any child widget
- Story demonstrates all states
