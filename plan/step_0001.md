# Step 1: Project Setup and Dependencies

## Context
We are building a FormLayout widget for Flutter that allows drag and drop grid layout of widgets to create customizable forms. This is the first step to set up the project foundation.

## Task
Set up the initial Flutter project structure and add the required dependencies.

## Prompt
```text
Create a new Flutter project with the following structure and dependencies:

1. Initialize a Flutter project if not already done
2. Add these dependencies to pubspec.yaml:
   - storybook_flutter: ^3.0.0 (for component development and testing)
   - flutter_layout_grid: ^2.0.0 (for grid layout functionality)
   - flutter_hooks: ^0.20.0 (for state management)
   - undo: ^2.0.0 (for undo/redo functionality)

3. Create the following directory structure:
   - lib/
     - form_layout/
       - widgets/
       - models/
       - hooks/
       - intents/
       - utils/
     - stories/

4. Create a basic main.dart that runs a simple MaterialApp
5. Create a storybook_app.dart file that sets up the Storybook for development
6. Add a simple README.md explaining the project structure

Make sure all dependencies are properly installed and the project runs without errors.
```

## Success Criteria
- Project structure is created
- All dependencies are added and resolved
- Both main.dart and storybook_app.dart run without errors
- flutter analyze shows no errors
