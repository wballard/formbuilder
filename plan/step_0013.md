# Step 13: Draggable Placed Widgets

## Context
Widgets already placed on the grid need to be draggable so users can move them to new positions.

## Task
Make PlacedWidget draggable to support moving widgets on the grid.

## Prompt
```text
Update PlacedWidget to support dragging:

1. Wrap PlacedWidget content with Draggable<WidgetPlacement>:
   - Data should be the WidgetPlacement
   - Use regular Draggable (not LongPressDraggable) for quick interaction
   - Enable only if not in preview mode (add bool canDrag property)

2. Configure drag appearance:
   - Feedback: Semi-transparent (0.7 opacity) version of the widget
   - Child while dragging: Empty container (widget appears to be picked up)
   - Maintain original size in feedback

3. Add drag callbacks as properties:
   - void Function(WidgetPlacement)? onDragStarted  
   - void Function()? onDragEnd
   - void Function(DraggableDetails)? onDragCompleted

4. Update PlacedWidget styling:
   - Add 'grab' cursor when hovering (if canDrag)
   - Show 'grabbing' cursor while dragging
   - Subtle scale animation on drag start (scale to 1.05)

5. Create a DraggingPlacedWidget widget for feedback:
   - Wraps the child with Material for elevation
   - Adds shadow for depth perception
   - Applies the semi-transparent effect

6. Update tests:
   - Test draggable configuration
   - Test canDrag enables/disables dragging
   - Test visual feedback during drag

This allows repositioning widgets already on the grid.
```

## Success Criteria
- Placed widgets can be dragged when canDrag is true
- Visual feedback clearly shows widget being moved
- Original position shows as empty during drag
- Cursor feedback enhances usability
- Drag callbacks provide proper lifecycle
