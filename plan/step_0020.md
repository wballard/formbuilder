# Step 20: Undo/Redo Implementation

## Context
Users need to be able to undo and redo their form building actions.

## Task
Implement undo/redo functionality using the undo package.

## Prompt
```text
Add undo/redo support to the form layout system:

1. Create FormLayoutCommand abstract class in lib/form_layout/utils/commands.dart:
   - Extends Change from undo package
   - Abstract methods for execute/undo
   - Store necessary data for reversal

2. Implement concrete commands:
   - AddWidgetCommand
   - RemoveWidgetCommand  
   - MoveWidgetCommand
   - ResizeWidgetCommand
   - ResizeGridCommand
   - Each stores before/after state

3. Update useFormLayout hook:
   - Add ChangeStack for undo/redo
   - Wrap all operations in commands
   - Add methods: undo(), redo(), canUndo, canRedo
   - Add clearHistory() method

4. Command implementation example:
   - MoveWidgetCommand stores: widgetId, oldPlacement, newPlacement
   - Execute: updates widget position
   - Undo: restores original position

5. Add undo/redo limit:
   - Default limit: 50 operations
   - Configurable via hook parameter
   - Old operations are discarded

6. Create tests:
   - Test each command type
   - Test undo/redo sequences
   - Test history limits
   - Test command grouping

7. Hook integration:
   - All state changes go through commands
   - Maintain consistency during undo/redo

This enables users to experiment freely with undo safety.
```

## Success Criteria
- All operations can be undone/redone
- Command pattern is clean and extensible
- History has reasonable limits
- State remains consistent through undo/redo
- Tests verify complex undo sequences
