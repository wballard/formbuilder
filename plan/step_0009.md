# Step 9: Grid Container Widget

## Context
We need a container widget that combines the GridWidget with PlacedWidgets, managing their layout together.

## Task
Create GridContainer that overlays PlacedWidgets on top of the GridWidget.

## Prompt
```text
Create GridContainer in lib/form_layout/widgets/grid_container.dart:

1. Create a stateless GridContainer with properties:
   - LayoutState layoutState
   - Map<String, Widget> widgetBuilders (widget name -> widget instance)
   - String? selectedWidgetId
   - Set<String> draggingWidgetIds (default: empty)
   - Set<Point<int>>? highlightedCells
   - Color? highlightColor
   - bool Function(Point<int>)? isCellValid
   - void Function(String widgetId)? onWidgetTap

2. Implementation:
   - Use Stack to layer PlacedWidgets over GridWidget
   - Use LayoutGrid to position PlacedWidgets according to their placement
   - Each PlacedWidget should span correct columns/rows
   - Pass through highlighting to underlying GridWidget

3. Widget building:
   - Look up widget builders using placement.widgetName
   - Wrap each with PlacedWidget
   - Set selected/dragging states based on IDs
   - Connect tap callbacks

4. Create tests in test/widgets/grid_container_test.dart:
   - Test widgets are positioned correctly
   - Test selection state management
   - Test dragging state management
   - Test missing widget builders show error

5. Create comprehensive Storybook story:
   - Show container with multiple widgets placed
   - Interactive selection example
   - Show different grid sizes with widgets

This creates the main visualization of the form layout.
```

## Success Criteria
- Widgets render at correct grid positions
- Selection and dragging states work
- Grid highlighting shows through
- Layout updates when state changes
- Story shows realistic form layouts
