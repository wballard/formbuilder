# Step 17: Delete Widget Functionality

## Context
Users need to be able to delete widgets from the grid.

## Task
Add delete functionality to remove widgets from the form layout.

## Prompt
```text
Implement widget deletion functionality:

1. Add delete button to PlacedWidget:
   - Show delete icon button when widget is selected
   - Position in top-right corner using Stack
   - Icon: Icons.close or Icons.delete
   - Size: 24x24
   - Background: Semi-transparent circle
   - void Function()? onDelete callback

2. Update delete button styling:
   - Show on hover or when selected
   - Red color on hover
   - Tooltip: "Delete widget"
   - Smooth fade in/out animation

3. Add keyboard support:
   - Delete key removes selected widget
   - Backspace as alternative
   - Only when widget has focus

4. Add confirmation (optional):
   - For complex widgets, show confirmation dialog
   - Simple widgets delete immediately
   - Add bool requireDeleteConfirmation to WidgetPlacement

5. Update GridContainer:
   - Add void Function(String widgetId)? onWidgetDelete
   - Connect delete callbacks
   - Handle keyboard events

6. Create tests:
   - Test delete button appears/hides correctly
   - Test delete callback is invoked
   - Test keyboard deletion
   - Test confirmation dialog when required

7. Update story:
   - Show deletion in action
   - Demonstrate keyboard shortcuts

This allows users to remove unwanted widgets from the form.
```

## Success Criteria
- Delete button appears for selected widgets
- Clicking delete removes the widget
- Keyboard shortcuts work
- Optional confirmation prevents accidental deletion
- Visual feedback is clear but not intrusive
