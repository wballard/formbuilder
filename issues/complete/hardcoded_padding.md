There are multiple places in the code that have padding and other values in hard coded pixes.

This is expressely forbidden in the Coding Standards and should be corrected to be one of:

- ems -- whole or fraction of the default font size
- theme driven and not passed in or set at all, such as toolbox

It is offensive that you would defy me so, I was clear in the coding standards.
