When resizing a widget in the Overview story, the actual size is not changing.

When selecting a second time, the drag handles are the orginal number of cells.

Shrinking -- say the Name text box, does not size down.

And -- the drag select box *must* remain visible and resize based on the mouse motion.
Havign just the selected drag handle move and the rest of the drag selection hide is COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE.
