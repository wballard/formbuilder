When I resize a widget, the drag handle moves, but the widget itself does not.

The hit testing for drag and drop of a widget isn't working for anything except the first row.

The drag handles move, but the drag box does not resize, nor does the widget.

The drag handle hit test regions are too small.

Use the Features/Resize Widgets story as the example to debug.
