# Grid Sizing Fix Summary

## Issue Found
The widgets placed in the grid were rendering with 0x0 size, making them invisible. The investigation revealed two main issues:

### 1. PlacedWidget BoxConstraints Issue
In `lib/form_layout/widgets/placed_widget.dart`, the Container had:
```dart
constraints: const BoxConstraints.expand(),
```

This was causing widgets to try to expand infinitely within the grid cells, which conflicted with how CSS Grid layouts (via `flutter_layout_grid`) work. Grid cells have specific sizes determined by track sizing, and children should size themselves within those constraints.

**Fix Applied**: Removed the `BoxConstraints.expand()` constraint to let the grid layout handle sizing naturally.

### 2. GridWidget Overflow Issue
In `lib/form_layout/widgets/grid_widget.dart`, the grid was using fixed row heights that didn't account for the border and padding, causing overflow errors in tests:
```dart
rowSizes: List.generate(
  widget.dimensions.rows, 
  (_) => FixedTrackSize(formTheme.rowHeight),
),
```

**Fix Applied**: Changed to use fractional units (`1.fr`) to fill available space evenly:
```dart
rowSizes: List.generate(
  widget.dimensions.rows, 
  (_) => 1.fr, // Use fractional units to fill available space evenly
),
```

### 3. Stack Layout in GridContainer
Added `Positioned.fill` to ensure proper sizing of Stack children in `lib/form_layout/widgets/grid_container.dart`.

## Results
- Grid widgets now render with proper sizes
- Fixed the RenderLayoutGrid overflow errors in golden tests
- Golden tests have been updated to reflect the new layout

## Remaining Issues
There are still 10 failing tests, but they appear to be unrelated to the grid sizing issue:
- FormLayout toolbox height test (expects 200, gets 600)
- Some accessibility tests
- Other unrelated test failures

The core grid sizing issue has been resolved, allowing widgets to be visible and properly sized within the grid layout.
